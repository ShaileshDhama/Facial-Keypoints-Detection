# Facial-Keypoints-Detection

**Primary Objective:-** Detect the location of keypoints on face images

The objective of this project is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1.Tracking faces in images and video

2.Analysing facial expressions

3.Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis

4.Biometrics / face recognition

5.Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  
Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. 
Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
