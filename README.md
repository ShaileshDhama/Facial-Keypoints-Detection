# Facial-Keypoints-Detection

**Primary Objective:-** Detect the location of keypoints on face images

The objective of this project is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1.Tracking faces in images and video

2.Analysing facial expressions

3.Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis

4.Biometrics / face recognition

5.Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  
Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. 
Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.


CNN as a deep learning algorithm was designed for such problems.
but the main difference in using it or other classifiers are in those areas:

**1.Data Dependencies** (The most important difference between deep learning and traditional machine learning is its performance as the
    scale of data increases. When the data is small, deep learning
    algorithms donâ€™t perform that well. This is because deep learning
    algorithms need a large amount of data to understand it perfectly)
**2.Hardware Dependency** (Deep learning algorithms heavily depend on high-end machines)
**3.Problem Solving Approach** (Deep learning in contrast advocates to solve the problem end-to-end)
**4.Feature Engineering** (Deep learning algorithms try to learn high-level features from data)
**5.Execution time** (deep learning algorithm takes a long time to train)
