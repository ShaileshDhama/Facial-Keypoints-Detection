# Facial keypoints Detection

**Author**: SHAILESH DHAMA

### Business problem:

    - To detect the location of keypoints on face images

    The objective of this project is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

      1.Tracking faces in images and video
      2.Analysing facial expressions
      3.Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
      4.Biometrics / face recognition
      5.Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.

### Data
Data can include source and high-level description (e.g. # obs)

## STEPS :

- Data Preprocessing and cleaning
- Fully connected sequential model.
- Training with fully connected sequential model.
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Training with Convolutional Neural Network.
- CNN after employing flipped Image Data Generator.
- Training with CNN(flippedImage)
